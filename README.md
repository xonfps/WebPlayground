# WebPlayground

"WebPlayground" is a project that I've created to help me and other developers explore and experiment with new features in web development. It's a collection of interactive examples and code snippets that demonstrate various web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. I've built this project to be a safe place to test and prototype new ideas and techniques, making it an invaluable tool for learning and advancing in the field of web development. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out, WebPlayground is the perfect place to play and experiment with the latest web technologies.
